The first app I’m sharing here is
one that helps you find answers in 
the Word Cookies game

It works by receiving a word’s
letters as input and generating 
all possible word combinations 
that can be formed from them.

You can access this app at
https://edozie-python-projects.onrender.com/word_cookies


Type all the letters of the word in 
uppercase, then click ENTER.  
The result will show all valid 
English words that can be formed
from those letters.
